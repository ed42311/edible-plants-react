The marketing department would like to speed up the checkout experience of Murdochs.com to improve conversion. You think creating a RESTful API service for the cart would go a long way to improve performance.

Create a REST API with a web framework of your choice which allows for adding and deleting products to a shopping cart. Additionally it should be possible to update the quantity of a product already in the cart. For the minimal viable product it is not necessary to build out a frontend user interface but if it helps you to conceptualize project feel free to do so.

Happy to answer any questions which help you understanding the project better and move along.

Happy Coding :)
